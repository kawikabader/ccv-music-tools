### Notes

* All test files are now located in the `test/` directory at the project root.
* Use `npm test` to run all tests
* Use `npm run build` to create production build
* Use `npm run deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages

### Password Generation Pattern

For security and consistency, user passwords follow this pattern:
* Format: `{username}#{last4_phone}`
* Example: For a user with username "johndoe" and phone "(480) 555-1234", the password would be `johndoe#1234`

This pattern ensures:
* Passwords are unique to each user
* Contains letters, numbers, and a special character
* Easy to remember (based on known information)
* Minimum 8 characters in length
