can you help me fix this error

_**Assistant**_

The error is coming from Tailwind CSS's PostCSS configuration. Let me help you fix this.

First, let's install the correct package:


---

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^8.0.0
```

```
➜  team-roster git:(main) ✗ npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^8.0.0                     n
pm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^8.0.0

➜  team-roster git:(main) ✗
```

---

Now let's check your PostCSS configuration:


---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "postcss.config" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Let me check the current configuration:


---

Read file: postcss.config.js

---

Let me update the PostCSS configuration:


---

```diff
  export default {
    plugins: {
-     tailwindcss: {},
+     '@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat': {},
      autoprefixer: {}
    }
```

---

Now let's restart your development server:


---

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
➜  team-roster git:(main) ✗ npm run dev

> team-roster@0.0.0 dev
