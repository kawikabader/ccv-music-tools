# Web App for Music Director Contacts (2025-05-28 10:24:10)

_**User**_

@create-prd.mdc I want to create a web app that allows music directors to login and find all of the phone numbers for all of our musicians. The app needs to be hosted and run for free on github pages.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help create a PRD for this music director contact management system. Let me ask some clarifying questions first:

1. **Authentication & Access:**
   - How many music directors need access? Is this for a specific organization?
   - Should there be different permission levels (e.g., admin vs regular director)?

2. **Musician Data:**
   - What information besides phone numbers do you want to store for each musician? (e.g., name, instrument, email, availability)
   - How many musicians are in the database approximately?
   - Do you need to group musicians by any criteria (e.g., instrument type, section)?

3. **Features:**
   - Do you need search/filter capabilities?
   - Should directors be able to add/edit musician information?
   - Do you need any export functionality (e.g., export to CSV)?
   - Should there be a way to contact multiple musicians at once?

4. **Data Storage:**
   - Since this will be hosted on GitHub Pages (static hosting), we'll need a backend solution. Would you prefer:
     a) A simple JSON file stored in the repo
     b) A free backend service (like Firebase)
     c) GitHub API to store data in issues/comments

5. **UI/UX:**
   - Do you have any specific design preferences?
   - Should it be mobile-friendly?
   - Do you need any specific accessibility features?

6. **Security:**
   - How sensitive is the contact information?
   - Do you need any specific security measures beyond basic authentication?

Let me know your answers to these questions, and I'll create a detailed PRD that addresses your specific needs.

_**User**_

1. There may be about 40 music directors and staff who need access. It is for my church: CCV. There should be 2 permission levels: admin and music director.
2. Name, instrument and phone number. There are maybe 200 musiciains. We do not need to group the musicians.
3. We will need search/filter capabilities. Directors cannot add/edit musicians; only admins can. Export/import csv functionality would be great. We do not need a way to contact musicians.
4. A simple JSON file stored in the repo is great. 
5. It needs to be minimal, fast and optimized for mobile.
6. The repo will be marked as private to keep everyone except me from seeing the contact info db. Other than that, basic auth is fine.

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a PRD based on your requirements. Let me write that up for you.

+ # Musician Contact Directory PRD
+ 
+ ## Introduction/Overview
+ A secure, mobile-optimized web application for CCV music directors to access musician contact information. The system will be hosted on GitHub Pages with a private repository to maintain data security.
+ 
+ ## Goals
+ 1. Provide quick access to musician contact information for authorized music directors
+ 2. Maintain data security through private repository and basic authentication
+ 3. Enable efficient search and filtering of musician information
+ 4. Support CSV import/export for admin data management
+ 5. Ensure mobile-first, fast user experience
+ 
+ ## User Stories
+ 1. As a music director, I want to search for musicians by name or instrument so I can quickly find their contact information
+ 2. As a music director, I want to view all musician information in a mobile-friendly format
+ 3. As an admin, I want to import/export musician data via CSV to maintain the database
+ 4. As an admin, I want to add/edit musician information to keep the database current
+ 5. As a music director, I want to securely access the system with my credentials
+ 
+ ## Functional Requirements
+ 1. Authentication System
+    - Must support two user roles: admin and music director
+    - Must implement basic authentication
+    - Must restrict access to authorized users only
+ 
+ 2. Musician Data Management
+    - Must store: name, instrument, phone number for each musician
+    - Must support approximately 200 musician records
+    - Must be stored in a JSON file within the private repository
+ 
+ 3. Search and Filter
+    - Must allow searching by musician name
+    - Must allow filtering by instrument
+    - Must provide instant search results
+ 
+ 4. Admin Features
+    - Must allow CSV import of musician data
+    - Must allow CSV export of musician data
+    - Must provide interface for adding new musicians
+    - Must provide interface for editing existing musician information
+ 
+ 5. User Interface
+    - Must be mobile-first and responsive
+    - Must load quickly (< 2 seconds)
+    - Must have minimal, clean design
+    - Must be accessible on all modern browsers
+ 
+ ## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
+ 1. Grouping or categorization of musicians
+ 2. Direct communication features
+ 3. Musician availability tracking
+ 4. Complex permission levels beyond admin/director
+ 5. Real-time updates or collaboration features
+ 
+ ## Technical Considerations
+ 1. Frontend:
+    - React.js for the UI framework
+    - Tailwind CSS for styling
+    - GitHub Pages for hosting
+    - Private repository for data security
+ 
+ 2. Data Storage:
+    - JSON file structure:
+    ```json
+    {
+      "musicians": [
+        {
+          "id": "string",
+          "name": "string",
+          "instrument": "string",
+          "phone": "string"
+        }
+      ],
+      "users": [
+        {
+          "id": "string",
+          "name": "string",
+          "role": "admin|director",
+          "email": "string"
+        }
+      ]
+    }
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. Authentication:
+    - Basic authentication using GitHub OAuth
+    - Role-based access control
+ 
+ ## Success Metrics
+ 1. System loads in under 2 seconds on mobile devices
+ 2. Search results appear within 500ms
+ 3. Zero unauthorized access attempts
+ 4. Successful CSV import/export operations
+ 5. Positive user feedback from music directors
+ 
+ ## Open Questions
+ 1. Should we implement any rate limiting for search operations?
+ 2. Do we need to implement any data validation rules for phone numbers?
+ 3. Should we add any audit logging for admin actions?
+ 4. Do we need to implement any data backup strategy beyond the repository?
+ 
+ ## Implementation Notes
+ 1. The application will be built as a single-page application (SPA)
+ 2. All data will be stored in a single JSON file in the repository
+ 3. The application will be deployed to GitHub Pages
+ 4. The repository will be private to maintain data security
+ 5. Basic authentication will be implemented using GitHub OAuth 
```

I've created a comprehensive PRD for your musician contact directory system. The PRD covers all the requirements you specified and includes technical details for implementation. A few key points to highlight:

1. The system will be built as a React SPA with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, fast experience
2. Data will be stored in a simple JSON file in the private repository
3. Authentication will use GitHub OAuth for security
4. The interface will be minimal and optimized for mobile use
5. Admin features include CSV import/export and musician management

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing the system?
2. Clarify any part of the PRD?
3. Add any additional requirements I might have missed?

I've created a comprehensive task list that breaks down the implementation into manageable chunks. The tasks are organized into 7 main sections:

1. Project Setup and Configuration
2. Authentication System Implementation
3. Data Management System
4. User Interface Development
5. Admin Features Implementation
6. Performance Optimization
7. Final Steps

Each section has detailed sub-tasks that cover all the requirements from the PRD. I've also included a list of relevant files that will need to be created or modified, along with some helpful notes about testing and deployment.

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing any specific task?
2. Provide more details about any particular section?
3. Add any additional tasks I might have missed?

---

_**User**_

Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list.mdc 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll start with task 1.1: Initialize React project with TypeScript. First, I'll create the project using Vite (which is faster and more modern than Create React App).


---

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

```
➜  team-roster npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
Need to install the following packages:
create-vite@6.5.0
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

---

Now I'll install the base dependencies:


---

```bash
npm install
```

```
npm error code ENOENT
npm error syscall open
npm error path /Users/kawikabader/Documents/projects/team-roster/package.json
npm error errno -2

ader/Documents/projects/team-roster/package.json'
                            npm error enoent This is related to npm not being ab

-debug-0.log
                            
```

---

I see we need to confirm the Vite installation first. Let me update the task list to reflect our progress:


---

```diff

    + [ ] 1.3 Configure GitHub Pages deployment
```

---

I need your confirmation to proceed with the Vite installation. Please type 'y' to confirm the installation of create-vite@6.5.0, and then I'll continue with the setup.

---

_**User**_

y

---

_**Assistant**_

Great, let's continue with the Vite installation:


---

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

```
➜  team-roster npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

> team-roster@0.0.0 npx
> create-vite . --template react-ts

│
◇  Current directory is not empty. Please choose how to proceed:
│  Cancel operation
└  Operation cancelled

➜  team-roster
```

---

I see we need to handle the non-empty directory. Let's create a new directory for our project and initialize it there:


---

```bash
mkdir -p musician-directory && cd musician-directory && npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

```
<y && npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

> team-roster@0.0.0 npx

Now let's install the dependencies:


---

```bash
npm install

---

Let's verify the project structure and update our task list:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory musician-directory • **13** results</summary>

```

---

Task 1.1 is now complete! I've:
1. Created a new React + TypeScript project using Vite
2. Installed all base dependencies
3. Verified the project structure

Would you like me to proceed with task 1.2 (Set up Tailwind CSS)?

---

_**User**_

I have moved the project files into the root directory. The name of the app is Team Roster. Very that task 1.1 is now complete.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll verify the project structure in the root directory:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **15** results</summary>

</details>

---

Let me check the package.json to verify the project name:


---

Read file: package.json

---

I'll update the package.json to reflect the correct project name:


---

```diff
  {
-   "name": "musician-directory",
+   "name": "team-roster",
    "private": true,
    "version": "0.0.0",
```

---

Perfect! I can confirm that:
1. The project files are now in the root directory
2. The project name has been updated to "team-roster"
3. All necessary files for a React + TypeScript project are present
4. Task 1.1 is complete

Would you like me to proceed with task 1.2 (Set up Tailwind CSS)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with task 1.2: Set up Tailwind CSS. First, let's install Tailwind and its dependencies:


---

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer && npx tailwindcss init -p
```

```

---

Let me create the configuration files manually:


---

```diff
- 
+ /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
+ export default {
+   content: [
+     "./index.html",
+     "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
+   ],
+   theme: {
+     extend: {},
+   },
+   plugins: [],
+ } 
```

---

```diff
- 
+ export default {
+   plugins: {
+     tailwindcss: {},
+     autoprefixer: {},
+   },
+ } 
```

---

Now let's add Tailwind directives to our CSS:


---

```diff
+ @tailwind base;
+ @tailwind components;
+ @tailwind utilities;
+ 
  :root {
    font-family: system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
```

---

Let's verify the setup by updating App.tsx to use some Tailwind classes:


---

```diff
  
    return (
-     <>
-       <div>
-         <a href="https://vite.dev" target="_blank">

+             </div>
+           </div>
+         </div>
        </div>
-       <h1>Vite + React</h1>
-       <div className="card">
-         <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
-           count is {count}
-         </button>
-         <p>
-           Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to test HMR
-         </p>
-       </div>
-       <p className="read-the-docs">
-         Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more
-       </p>
-     </>
+     </div>
    )
  }
```

---

Let me fix those linter errors by removing the unused imports and state:


---

```diff
  
  function App() {
-   const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
- 
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100 py-6 flex flex-col justify-center sm:py-12">
```

---

Let me remove the remaining unused imports:


---



---

Let me try to read the current content of App.tsx to see what imports need to be removed:


---

Read file: src/App.tsx

---

Now I'll remove the unused imports:


---

```diff
- import { useState } from 'react'
- import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
- import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
  import './App.css'
  
```

---

Now let's update the task list to mark task 1.2 as completed:


---

```diff
  * [ ] 1.0 Project Setup and Configuration
    + [x] 1.1 Initialize React project with TypeScript
-   + [ ] 1.2 Set up Tailwind CSS
+   + [x] 1.2 Set up Tailwind CSS
    + [ ] 1.3 Configure GitHub Pages deployment
    + [ ] 1.4 Set up testing environment (Jest + React Testing Library)
```

---

Task 1.2 is now complete! I've:
1. Installed Tailwind CSS and its dependencies
2. Created the necessary configuration files
3. Added Tailwind directives to the CSS
4. Updated the App component with Tailwind classes
5. Fixed all linter errors

Would you like me to proceed with task 1.3 (Configure GitHub Pages deployment)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with task 1.3: Configure GitHub Pages deployment. First, let's install the GitHub Pages deployment package:


---

```bash
npm install -D gh-pages
```

Now let's update the package.json to add deployment scripts:


---

```diff
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "type": "module",
+   "homepage": "https://kawikabader.github.io/team-roster",
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",

+     "predeploy": "npm run build",
+     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    },
    "dependencies": {
```

---

Now let's update the Vite configuration to handle GitHub Pages base path:


---

```diff
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
  
- // https://vite.dev/config/
+ // https://vitejs.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
+   base: '/team-roster/',
  })
  
```

---

Let's create a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment:


---

```diff
- 
+ name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
+ 
+ on:
+   push:
+     branches: [ main ]
+ 
+ jobs:
+   build-and-deploy:
+     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+     steps:
+       - name: Checkout
+         uses: actions/checkout@v4
+ 
+       - name: Setup Node.js
+         uses: actions/setup-node@v4
+         with:
+           node-version: '20'
+           cache: 'npm'

+         with:
+           folder: dist
+           branch: gh-pages 
```

---

Let's update the task list to mark task 1.3 as completed:


---

```diff
    + [x] 1.1 Initialize React project with TypeScript
    + [x] 1.2 Set up Tailwind CSS
-   + [ ] 1.3 Configure GitHub Pages deployment
+   + [x] 1.3 Configure GitHub Pages deployment
    + [ ] 1.4 Set up testing environment (Jest + React Testing Library)
    + [ ] 1.5 Create initial project structure and file organization
```

---

Task 1.3 is now complete! I've:
1. Installed gh-pages package
2. Added deployment scripts to package.json
3. Updated Vite configuration for GitHub Pages
4. Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

To deploy the app, you'll need to:
1. Create a GitHub repository named "team-roster"
2. Push your code to the main branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings

Would you like me to proceed with task 1.4 (Set up testing environment)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with task 1.4: Set up testing environment (Jest + React Testing Library). First, let's install the necessary testing packages:


---

```bash
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom @types/jest
```

```
➜  team-roster npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event j

Now let's create the Jest configuration file:


---

```diff

```

---

Let's install ts-jest and identity-obj-proxy:

---

Let's create a mock file for static assets:


---

```diff
-

Let's create a sample test for App.tsx to verify our setup:


---

```diff
-

+ import App from './App'
+ 
+ describe('App', () => {

- All config files and mocks are in place.

Ready to proceed with task 1.5 (Create initial project structure and file organization)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with task 1.5: Create initial project structure and file organization.

Here's what I'll do:
- Create directories for components: `Auth`, `MusicianList`, `Admin`
- Add placeholder files for each main component and their test files
- Add data and utils directories with placeholder files
- Add a types directory for shared TypeScript types

Let's create the structure and placeholder files:


---

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/Auth src/components/MusicianList src/components/Admin src/data src/utils src/types && touch src/components/Auth/Login.tsx src/components/Auth/Login.test.tsx src/components/MusicianList/MusicianList.tsx src/components/MusicianList/MusicianList.test.tsx src/components/Admin/AdminPanel.tsx src/components/Admin/AdminPanel.test.tsx src/data/musicians.json src/data/users.json src/utils/auth.ts src/utils/auth.test.ts src/utils/csv.ts src/utils/csv.test.ts src/types/index.ts
```

```

```

---

```diff

+ 
```

---

```diff
- 
+ // Auth utility placeholder

```

---

```diff
- 
+ // CSV utility placeholder
+ 
```

---

```diff

    + [ ] 1.6 Set up ESLint and Prettier
    + [ ] 1.7 Create basic README.md with setup instructions
```

---

Task 1.5 is now complete!  
- The initial directory structure is in place
- All main component, utility, data, and type placeholder files are created

Ready to proceed with task 1.6 (Set up ESLint and Prettier)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with task 1.6: Set up ESLint and Prettier.

Steps:
1. Install ESLint, Prettier, and relevant plugins/configs
2. Create ESLint and Prettier config files
3. Add scripts to package.json

Let's start by installing the dependencies:


---

```bash
npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

```
➜  team-roster git:(main) ✗ npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier @typescrip
npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @type
script-eslint/parser

+     "format": "prettier --write .",
      "preview": "vite preview",
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
```

---

ESLint and Prettier are now set up!  
- Config files `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` are created
- Scripts for linting and formatting are in `package.json`
- All dependencies are installed

Would you like me to proceed with task 1.7 (Create basic README.md with setup instructions)?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a basic README.md with setup, development, testing, and deployment instructions for Team Roster.
