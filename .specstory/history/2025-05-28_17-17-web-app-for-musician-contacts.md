# Web App for Musician Contacts (2025-05-28 10:17:25)

_**User**_

@create-prd.mdc I want to create a web app that allows music directors to login and find all of the phone numbers for all of our musicians. The app needs to be hosted and run for free on github pages.

I'll help you create a simple web app for managing musician contact information. Since we need to host it on GitHub Pages for free, we'll use a static site approach with client-side storage.

Let me first check what files we have in the workspace.

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory ‚Ä¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `.cursor` |

</details>

Great, we're starting fresh. Let's create a modern React app using Vite, which is perfect for static sites. I'll set up the project structure and implement the core functionality.


---

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

```
‚ûú  team-roster npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
Need to install the following packages:
create-vite@6.5.0
Ok to proceed? (y)
```
