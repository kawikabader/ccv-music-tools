# User Access Management System Proposal

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive workflow and system for managing user access to the Team Roster application. The proposed system builds upon the existing Supabase Auth infrastructure while introducing streamlined processes for user onboarding, role management, and access control.

## üèóÔ∏è Current System Overview

### Existing Infrastructure

* **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
* **Authorization**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL
* **User Roles**: `admin` (full access) and `director` (read-only)
* **Profile Management**: Automatic profile creation via database triggers
* **Security**: Database-level access control with encrypted communication

### Current Limitations

* Manual user creation through Supabase Dashboard
* No self-service user management interface
* Limited role granularity
* No automated invitation workflow
* No user activity tracking

## üöÄ Proposed Access Management Workflow

### 1. **User Invitation System**

#### **Method A: Admin Dashboard (Recommended)**

Create an in-app admin panel for user management:

**Features:**
* Email invitation system with role selection
* Bulk user import via CSV
* Real-time user status tracking
* Automated welcome emails with login instructions
* Invitation expiry and resend functionality

**Workflow:**
1. Admin navigates to "User Management" section
2. Clicks "Invite User" button
3. Enters email, selects role, adds optional display name
4. System sends invitation email with setup link
5. New user clicks link, sets password, auto-logged in
6. Profile created with assigned role

#### **Method B: Command Line Interface**

For technical administrators:

```bash
# Invite single user
npm run manage-users invite john@example.com director "John Smith"

# Bulk invite from CSV
npm run manage-users bulk-invite users.csv

# List all users
npm run manage-users list
```

#### **Method C: External Integration** 

For organizations with existing systems:

* **Google Workspace**: Sync users from Google Admin
* **Microsoft 365**: Azure AD integration
* **LDAP/Active Directory**: Corporate directory sync
* **Slack/Teams**: Import team members automatically

### 2. **Enhanced Role-Based Access Control**

#### **Proposed Role Structure**

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Super Admin** | Full system access, user management, settings | Organization owner |
| **Admin** | Full musician CRUD, user management | Music directors, managers |
| **Director** | Read musicians, basic editing | Assistant directors |
| **Member** | View own profile, limited musician view | Musicians themselves |
| **Guest** | View public performances only | Parents, supporters |

#### **Permission Matrix**

| Action | Super Admin | Admin | Director | Member | Guest |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| View Musicians | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Limited | ‚ùå |
| Add Musicians | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Edit Musicians | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Own Profile | Own Profile | ‚ùå |
| Delete Musicians | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Manage Users | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Export Data | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Limited | ‚ùå |
| View Analytics | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### 3. **User Lifecycle Management**

#### **Onboarding Process**

1. **Invitation**: Admin sends invitation with role assignment
2. **Account Setup**: User receives email, sets password
3. **Profile Completion**: User adds personal details, preferences
4. **Role Training**: In-app guidance based on assigned role
5. **First Login Success**: Welcome dashboard with role-specific features

#### **Ongoing Management**

* **Role Updates**: Easy promotion/demotion through admin interface
* **Access Reviews**: Quarterly access audits with automated reports
* **Activity Monitoring**: Track user engagement and feature usage
* **Deactivation**: Temporary suspension without data loss
* **Offboarding**: Secure account deletion with data retention options

### 4. **Self-Service Capabilities**

#### **User Profile Management**

* Update personal information
* Change password with email verification
* Upload profile photos
* Set notification preferences
* Download personal data (GDPR compliance)

#### **Access Requests**

* Request role elevation with justification
* Request access to specific features
* Submit support tickets through the app
* View audit log of their own actions

### 5. **Administrative Tools**

#### **User Management Dashboard**

* **User Overview**: Grid view with filtering and search
* **Role Assignment**: Drag-and-drop role management
* **Activity Timeline**: Real-time user actions and login history
* **Bulk Operations**: Mass role updates, deactivations, exports
* **Security Alerts**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity

#### **Reporting and Analytics**

* **Access Reports**: Who has access to what and when
* **Usage Analytics**: Feature adoption, user engagement metrics
* **Security Audits**: Authentication logs, permission changes
* **Compliance Reports**: GDPR, SOX, or other regulatory requirements
