# Security Documentation

## üîí Security Audit Summary

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Team Roster application and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

### ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

#### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

* **Supabase Auth Integration**: Industry-standard authentication service
* **JWT Token Management**: Automatic token refresh handled by Supabase
* **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
* **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin vs Director permissions

#### 2. **Environment Security**

* **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data stored in environment variables
* **Git Exclusion**: `.env` files properly excluded from version control
* **GitHub Secrets**: Production credentials stored in GitHub Actions secrets
* **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Zero hardcoded API keys or passwords in codebase

#### 3. **Data Protection**

* **Encrypted Communication**: HTTPS/TLS for all API communication
* **Password Security**: Delegated to Supabase (bcrypt hashing)
* **Database Security**: Supabase handles encryption at rest
* **Access Logging**: Supabase provides comprehensive audit logs

#### 4. **Code Security**

* **Input Validation**: TypeScript provides type safety
* **SQL Injection Prevention**: Supabase client handles parameterized queries
* **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection
* **No Eval Usage**: No dynamic code execution

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variables Required:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

#### Role Permissions:

* **Admin Role**: Full CRUD access to all resources
* **Director Role**: Read-only access to musician data
* **Unauthenticated**: No access to any protected resources

#### Database Security:

* **RLS Policies**: Enforce role-based access at database level
* **Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity protection
* **Automatic Triggers**: Profile creation on user registration

### üö® Security Considerations

#### 1. **Public Supabase Keys**

* The `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is intentionally public (client-side)
* Real security comes from RLS policies, not key secrecy
* Never use service_role key in client-side code

#### 2. **GitHub Pages Deployment**

* Environment variables are built into the static assets
* Supabase URL and anon key will be visible in compiled JavaScript
* This is normal and expected for client-side applications

#### 3. **Row Level Security**

* Database access is controlled by PostgreSQL RLS policies
* Users can only access data their role permits
* Policies are enforced at the database level, not client-side

### üìã Security Checklist

**Before Deployment:**
* [ ] Environment variables configured in GitHub Secrets
* [ ] RLS enabled on all sensitive tables
* [ ] Policies tested for both admin and director roles
* [ ] No sensitive data in console logs (production)
* [ ] HTTPS enabled for production domain
* [ ] Supabase project settings reviewed

**Regular Maintenance:**
* [ ] Review user roles quarterly
* [ ] Monitor Supabase audit logs
* [ ] Update dependencies regularly
* [ ] Review RLS policies after schema changes
* [ ] Validate environment variable security

### üîç Audit Trail

**Last Security Audit:** [Current Date]

**Items Addressed:**
* ‚úÖ Removed sensitive URL logging from development scripts
* ‚úÖ Added development-only console logging
* ‚úÖ Verified no hardcoded credentials
* ‚úÖ Confirmed proper environment variable handling
* ‚úÖ Validated RLS policy implementation

### üìû Security Incident Response

**If you suspect a security breach:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Rotate Supabase project keys
   - Review recent access logs in Supabase dashboard
   - Check for unauthorized user accounts

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review Supabase audit logs
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for deployment issues
   - Validate RLS policies are functioning

3. **Recovery:**
   - Update environment variables in GitHub Secrets
   - Redeploy application with new credentials
   - Document incident and prevention measures
